Optimizing Movie Ratings with Gradient Descent

I've been exploring the application of gradient descent to optimize movie ratings. The goal is to refine the rating matrix by filling in missing values and improving the overall accuracy of predictions.

The Challenge

Traditional collaborative filtering techniques often struggle with sparse rating matrices, where many user-movie combinations lack ratings.

The Solution

To address this, I've employed gradient descent to minimize the error between predicted and actual ratings. By iteratively adjusting the parameters of the model, we can gradually improve the accuracy of predictions.

The Process

Initialization: I initialize the rating matrix with random values for missing entries.
Prediction: I calculate the predicted rating for each missing entry using a suitable prediction function.
Error Calculation: I compute the error between the predicted rating and the actual rating (if available).
Gradient Descent: I update the parameters of the prediction function using the gradient of the error function.
Iteration: I repeat steps 2-4 until convergence or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
The Result
I'm excited to continue exploring the potential of gradient descent for optimizing movie ratings and other similar applications.
